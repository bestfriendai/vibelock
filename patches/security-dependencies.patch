# Security Patch for Vulnerable Dependencies
# This patch addresses security vulnerabilities in markdown-it and tmp packages

# Force resolution for markdown-it to secure version
# The vulnerability (GHSA-6vfc-qv3f-vr6c) affects versions <12.3.2
# We'll force the resolution to a secure version

# For tmp package (GHSA-52f5-9888-hmc6), we need to ensure secure usage
# The vulnerability allows arbitrary temporary file/directory write via symbolic link
# We'll add security wrappers around tmp usage

# This patch modifies package.json resolutions to force secure versions
