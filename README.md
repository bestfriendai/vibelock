## üö® Troubleshooting

### AutoLayoutView Error ("View config not found for component AutoLayoutView")

This error occurs due to React Native new architecture compatibility issues with certain dependencies. If you encounter this error:

**Immediate Fix:**

1. The app has been configured to disable the new architecture (`newArchEnabled: false` in `app.json`)
2. FlashList has been replaced with FlatList for better compatibility
3. React has been downgraded from 19.1.0 to 18.2.0 for React Native 0.81.4 compatibility
4. React Compiler has been disabled in babel configuration

**Manual Recovery Steps:**

```bash
# Run the automated fix script
bash scripts/fix-architecture-issues.sh

# Or run individual commands:
npx expo prebuild --clean
npm install
cd ios && pod install  # iOS only
npm start -- --clear
```

**Common Causes:**

- React Native new architecture enabled with incompatible dependencies
- Version mismatches between React, React Native, and related packages
- FlashList compatibility issues with Fabric renderer
- React Compiler incompatibility with older React Native versions

**When to Re-enable New Architecture:**

- All dependencies support the new architecture
- React Native is updated to 0.74+ with proper Fabric support
- FlashList or alternative has full new architecture compatibility

### Component Registration Errors

If you see errors about missing native modules or component registration:

1. **Clear caches:**

   ```bash
   npx expo prebuild --clean
   npm run clean:install
   ```

2. **Verify environment:**

   ```bash
   npm run verify:env
   npm run verify:setup
   ```

3. **Check native dependencies:**
   - Ensure all Expo modules are compatible with SDK 54
   - Verify React Native version compatibility
   - Check for any manually linked native modules

### Performance Issues with Lists

The app now uses FlatList instead of FlashList for better stability:

- **FlatList Optimizations:** Enhanced with performance props and responsive calculations
- **Memory Management:** Improved with `removeClippedSubviews` and windowing
- **Responsive Design:** Better column calculations for different screen sizes
