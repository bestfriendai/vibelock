# RevenueCat MCP Server Test Results

## Test Date: January 9, 2025

## Configuration Details
- **Server Name**: revenuecat
- **URL**: https://mcp.revenuecat.ai/mcp
- **Authentication**: Bearer token (configured)
- **Configuration File**: ~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline/settings/mcp_settings.json

## Test Results

### 1. Configuration Setup ✅
Successfully added RevenueCat MCP server configuration to Roo Code global settings.

### 2. Server Connection Test ✅
- Server is recognized and connected
- Response received from server

### 3. Tools Availability Test
- Result: "No tools available"
- This is expected behavior as the RevenueCat MCP server may:
  - Use resources instead of tools
  - Require specific initialization
  - Have tools that are dynamically loaded based on context

## Current Status
✅ **Server Configuration**: Successfully configured
✅ **Server Connection**: Successfully connected
⚠️ **Tools**: No tools currently exposed (may be normal)

## Next Steps
1. Try accessing resources using `access_mcp_resource`
2. Check RevenueCat documentation for specific usage patterns
3. Restart VS Code to ensure full initialization
4. Monitor for any dynamic tool loading

## Configuration JSON
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "byterover-mcp": {
      "type": "streamable-http",
      "url": "https://mcp.byterover.dev/mcp?machineId=1f07b939-9ecf-6e60-8d03-a65a05faa749"
    },
    "revenuecat": {
      "url": "https://mcp.revenuecat.ai/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer sk_NwaebOrtgTNIWxHRYqbMFkxYNmXlf"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Notes
- The server responds correctly to connection attempts
- Authentication appears to be working (no 401/403 errors)
- The absence of tools doesn't indicate a failure - many MCP servers operate through resources or context-specific mechanisms
