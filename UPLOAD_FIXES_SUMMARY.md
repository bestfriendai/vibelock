# Image/Video Upload Functionality Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Wrong Storage Service Usage** ❌➡️✅

**Problem**: The `reviewsStore.ts` was using the newer `storage.ts` service which requires authentication for all uploads, conflicting with the user preference to "maximize user review posting without barriers."

**Solution**:

- Changed import in `src/state/reviewsStore.ts` from `../services/storage` to `../services/storageService`
- Updated all upload method calls to use the correct signature: `uploadFile(fileUri, options)` instead of `uploadFile(bucket, path, file)`
- The `storageService.ts` supports anonymous uploads for review images

### 2. **RLS Policy Conflict** ❌➡️✅

**Problem**: Supabase RLS policies required authentication for review-images uploads, preventing anonymous users from posting reviews.

**Solution**:

- Created migration `supabase/migrations/20250121000001_allow_anonymous_review_uploads.sql`
- Updated RLS policies to allow anonymous uploads for review-images bucket
- Maintained security for update/delete operations (still require authentication)

### 3. **Outdated Permission Handling** ❌➡️✅

**Problem**: `MediaUploadGrid.tsx` was using deprecated permission APIs instead of modern hooks.

**Solution**:

- Updated to use modern permission hooks: `useCameraPermissions()` and `useMediaLibraryPermissions()`
- Replaced `requestPermissions()` with `ensurePermission(which: "camera" | "library")`
- Improved error handling and user feedback

### 4. **File Upload Method Signature Mismatch** ❌➡️✅

**Problem**: Upload calls were using wrong parameters, causing TypeScript errors and runtime failures.

**Solution**:

- Fixed image upload calls to use proper file URI and options object
- Added proper temporary file handling for video uploads and thumbnails
- Ensured proper cleanup of temporary files

## Files Modified

### Core Fixes

1. **`src/state/reviewsStore.ts`**
   - Changed storage service import
   - Fixed upload method calls for images and videos
   - Added proper temporary file handling
   - Improved error handling

2. **`src/components/MediaUploadGrid.tsx`**
   - Updated to modern permission hooks
   - Improved permission request flow
   - Better error messages

3. **`supabase/migrations/20250121000001_allow_anonymous_review_uploads.sql`**
   - New migration to allow anonymous uploads
   - Maintains security for other operations

### Testing & Utilities

4. **`src/utils/uploadTest.ts`** (New)
   - Comprehensive test utility for upload functionality
   - Tests permissions, image picker, and upload flow
   - Useful for debugging and verification

## Expo SDK 54 Compatibility ✅

The app is fully compatible with Expo SDK 54:

- Using modern permission hooks (`useCameraPermissions`, `useMediaLibraryPermissions`)
- Proper `expo-file-system/legacy` usage (still supported in SDK 54)
- Updated ImagePicker API usage
- Comprehensive PHPhotosErrorDomain 3164 workarounds already in place

## User Preferences Addressed ✅

- **Maximize user review posting**: Anonymous uploads now allowed for review images
- **No barriers to review creation**: Removed authentication requirement for uploads
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Works on both iOS and Android
- **Proper error handling**: User-friendly error messages and retry options

## Testing the Fixes

### Manual Testing

1. **Run the app** and navigate to Create Review screen
2. **Test image selection** from gallery and camera
3. **Test video selection** and upload
4. **Verify uploads** work for both authenticated and anonymous users

### Automated Testing

```typescript
import { runUploadTests } from "./src/utils/uploadTest";

// Run comprehensive upload tests
await runUploadTests();
```

## Migration Required

**Important**: Run the database migration to enable anonymous uploads:

```bash
# If using Supabase CLI
supabase db push

# Or apply the migration manually in Supabase dashboard
```

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the migration** to enable anonymous uploads
2. **Test thoroughly** on both iOS and Android devices
3. **Monitor upload success rates** in production
4. **Consider adding upload progress indicators** for better UX

## Security Considerations

- Anonymous uploads are only allowed for review-images bucket
- Users can still only delete their own uploads when authenticated
- File validation and sanitization remain in place
- RLS policies still protect other buckets and operations

The fixes maintain security while removing barriers to review creation, aligning with user preferences.
