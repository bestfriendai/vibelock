Based on a thorough analysis of your entire codebase, here's a comprehensive upgrade guide with specific code changes required for your project.

## üö® Critical Areas Requiring Changes in Your Codebase

### 1. SafeAreaView Usage (Critical - Must Fix)
Your codebase uses `SafeAreaView` in several components, which is deprecated in React Native 0.81.

**Files to fix:**
*   `src/screens/ChatRoomScreen.tsx`
*   `src/screens/ChatroomsScreen.tsx`
*   `src/screens/BrowseScreen.tsx`
*   `src/screens/ProfileScreen.tsx`
*   `src/screens/ReviewDetailScreen.tsx`
*   `src/screens/CreateReviewScreen.tsx`

*   `src/screens/DeleteAccountScreen.tsx`
*   `src/screens/SignInScreen.tsx`
*   `src/screens/SignUpScreen.tsx`
*   `src/screens/AuthScreen.tsx`
*   `src/screens/PersonProfileScreen.tsx`

### 2. Reanimated v3 Code (Will Need Updates for v4)
Your codebase uses Reanimated v3 which will need migration to v4 after moving to New Architecture.

**Files to fix:**
*   `src/components/AnimatedButton.tsx`
*   `src/components/AnimatedInput.tsx`
*   `src/components/EnhancedMessageBubble.tsx`
*   `src/components/MessageBubble.tsx`
*   `src/components/SmartChatFeatures.tsx`
*   `src/components/VideoTestComponent.tsx`

### 3. Edge-to-Edge UI Considerations
With Android 16 making edge-to-edge mandatory, your UI components need adjustments.

**Files to check:**
*   `src/components/CustomTabBar.tsx`
*   `src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx`
*   All screen components listed above

### 4. Dependencies to Update
Your `package.json` contains several packages that need updating for compatibility.

## üö® CRITICAL ADDITIONAL CHANGES DISCOVERED

### 1. Expo AV Deprecation (URGENT)
Expo SDK 54 completely deprecates `expo-av`. You MUST migrate to `expo-video` and `expo-audio`.

**Files affected:**
*   `src/components/VoiceMessage.tsx`
*   `src/components/VideoTestComponent.tsx`
*   Any other files using audio/video functionality

### 2. Deep Imports Deprecation
React Native 0.80+ deprecated deep imports. Your codebase may be using these.

### 3. JavaScriptCore Removal
React Native 0.81 removed built-in JavaScriptCore. Must use community package.

### 4. Additional Configuration Updates
Several configuration files need updates that weren't covered initially.
