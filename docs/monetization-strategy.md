# Monetization Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive monetization strategy for our React Native application. We'll implement a hybrid approach combining multiple revenue streams to maximize user value while generating sustainable income.

## Revenue Streams

### 1. In-App Advertising (AdMob)

**Implementation Status**: Dependencies installed (react-native-google-mobile-ads)

#### Ad Types to Implement:

- **Banner Ads**: Small, non-intrusive ads at the bottom of select screens
- **Interstitial Ads**: Full-screen ads at natural transition points (e.g., between levels, after completing a task)
- **Rewarded Ads**: Users opt-in to watch ads in exchange for in-app rewards or premium features
- **Native Ads**: Custom-designed ads that match the app's look and feel

#### Ad Placement Strategy:

- **Home Screen**: Small banner at the bottom
- **Content Pages**: Native ads integrated between content items
- **Task Completion**: Interstitial ads after completing major tasks
- **Premium Features**: Rewarded ads to unlock temporary access to premium features

### 2. In-App Purchases (RevenueCat)

**Implementation Status**: Dependencies installed (react-native-purchases)

#### Purchase Model:

- **Freemium Model**: Basic features free, premium features require purchase
- **One-time Purchases**: Permanent unlock of specific features
- **Subscriptions**: Recurring access to premium content and features

#### Subscription Tiers:

1. **Basic Tier ($2.99/month)**
   - Ad-free experience
   - Basic premium features
   - Monthly content updates

2. **Premium Tier ($7.99/month or $79.99/year)**
   - All Basic Tier benefits
   - Advanced premium features

#### One-time Purchase Options:

- **Remove Ads ($4.99)**

### 3. Affiliate Marketing
