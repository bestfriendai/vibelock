### 🔍 Troubleshooting

#### Installation Issues
1. **iOS "Untrusted Developer"**: Trust certificate in Settings > General > VPN & Device Management
2. **Android "Unknown Sources"**: Enable in Settings > Security
3. **Build Fails to Download**: Check device registration in Expo dashboard; use CLI for connected devices
4. **Version Conflicts**: Uninstall previous builds before installing new

#### RevenueCat Issues
1. **Paywall Not Showing**: Verify API keys in .env, restart app
2. **Purchase Fails**: Use sandbox Apple ID/Google test account; check logs for errors
3. **Premium Not Unlocking**: Test restoration, check Supabase sync
4. **Cross-Platform**: Ensure shared entitlements work on both iOS/Android

#### Feature-Specific Troubleshooting
- **Chat Not Real-Time**: Verify Supabase realtime subscription, check network
- **Location Errors**: Ensure permissions granted, test in different regions via VPN

- **Ads Still Showing**: Confirm premium status in RevenueCat, clear cache

#### Common General Issues
- **Crashes on Launch**: Check console logs, update Expo SDK if needed
