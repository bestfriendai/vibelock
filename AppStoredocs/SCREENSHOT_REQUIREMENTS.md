## Screenshot Content Strategy

To align with the app's general dating safety positioning for a broad audience, screenshots should showcase core features like anonymous reviews, real-time chat, advanced search, and safety tools. Use diverse but non-specific visuals (e.g., abstract user interfaces, sample content without demographic targeting) to emphasize accessibility, privacy, and global reach. Highlight inclusivity as a plus through welcoming, community-focused screens. Include text overlays for key benefits (e.g., "Instant Access - No Verification Needed").

### Recommended Screenshot Sequence (3-5 for Minimal Set)
1. **Main Feed/Home Screen (Required - First Screenshot for Search Visibility)**
   - Show the review feed with anonymous entries, location tags, and green/red flags
   - Highlight trending reviews or search bar for discovery
   - Overlay: "Discover Safer Dating with Anonymous Reviews"
   - Focus: Clean UI, global location indicators to appeal to broad, international users

2. **Review Creation Interface**
   - Display form for anonymous review with media upload, flags, sentiment options, and location tagging
   - Show preview of sample review (general dating experience, no specific demographics)
   - Overlay: "Share Experiences Privately - Media & Flags Included"
   - Focus: Ease of use, privacy emphasis for general audience

3. **Real-Time Chat & Community**
   - Show chatroom or direct messaging with typing indicators, reactions, online presence
   - Include topic-based room (e.g., "Dating Tips") with sample messages
   - Overlay: "Join Live Conversations for Advice & Support"
   - Focus: Engagement features for community-seeking users, broad appeal

4. **Advanced Search & Discovery**
   - Illustrate search results with filters (location, category, distance, sentiment)
   - Show results from global locations or trending content
   - Overlay: "Find Insights Worldwide - Filters for Location & More"
   - Focus: Global reach and smart tools for privacy-conscious researchers

5. **Safety Tools & Premium Features**
   - Depict reporting/blocking interface or premium paywall with ad-free, analytics benefits
   - Show safety dashboard or upgrade screen
   - Overlay: "Robust Safety & Premium Enhancements for Peace of Mind"
   - Focus: Protection and value for broad users, inclusive community guidelines

6. **Onboarding & Accessibility (Optional)**
   - Quick 30-second onboarding or guest mode entry
   - Overlay: "Start Instantly - No Barriers, No Waitlists"
   - Focus: Instant access for all, emphasizing general positioning

### Additional Tips for Broad Audience Appeal
- **Diversity & Inclusivity**: Use neutral, diverse abstract elements (e.g., varied icons, global maps) to show welcoming environment without targeting specific groups
- **Feature Emphasis**: Prioritize general features (anonymous sharing, real-time support, global filters) over niche; add more info like "AI Moderation for Safe Interactions"
- **Text Overlays**: Concise (under 50 chars), benefit-oriented (e.g., "Privacy Protected", "Global Community"); use app's color scheme for branding
- **Visual Consistency**: High-contrast, readable text; no clutter; show smooth animations if possible in videos
- **Content Realism**: Sample reviews/chat on general dating scenarios (e.g., "Great first date in NYC"); avoid any demographic-specific content
- **Localization**: Prepare variants for key markets (e.g., English, Spanish) with translated overlays
- **A/B Testing**: Test sets with/without overlays to optimize conversion for broad users

## App Preview Video (Optional but Recommended)
- **Duration**: 15-30 seconds (iOS), up to 2 minutes (Google Play)
- **Sizes**: Same as screenshots (e.g., 1290x2796 for iPhone 6.7")
- **Format**: MOV or MP4, 30 FPS, <500MB
- **Content**: Demo flow: Onboarding → Review creation → Chat join → Search results → Safety tool
- **Strategy**: Narrate benefits for general audience (e.g., "Share anonymously worldwide"); music-free or subtle; end with call-to-action "Download for Safer Dating"
- **Tips**: Use screen recording tools like QuickTime (iOS) or Android Studio; add subtitles for accessibility

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] All screenshots/videos high resolution, no blurriness or artifacts
- [ ] Consistent branding (colors, fonts, logo) across all
- [ ] UI elements fully visible, no cut-offs or overlaps
- [ ] Text overlays readable on small screens, high contrast
- [ ] Content follows guidelines: No inappropriate material, realistic app use
- [ ] Diverse representation: General users (abstract), global elements (maps, locations)
- [ ] Tested in store preview: How they appear in search/carousel
- [ ] File names organized (e.g., iphone_67_1.png)
- [ ] No placeholders; use sample data reflecting broad, inclusive features
- [ ] Optimized file sizes (<10MB per screenshot) for upload

## Tools for Screenshot Creation & Management
- **Device Simulators**: Xcode Simulator (iOS), Android Emulator (Google Play) for captures
- **Design Tools**: Figma, Sketch, or Photoshop for overlays/frames
- **Generators**: App Store Screenshot Creator, Preview My App for device mocks
- **Recording**: ScreenFlow or Loom for videos; ensure 60 FPS for smooth playback
- **Optimization**: TinyPNG for compression without quality loss
- **Testing**: App Store Preview (iOS) or Play Console Preview to validate

## Submission Tips
- **Order Importance**: First 3 screenshots appear in search; prioritize high-impact (e.g., feed, review creation)
- **Platform Differences**: iOS stricter on content (no suggestive); Google Play allows more but require data safety labels
- **Updates**: Refresh with major releases (e.g., new chat features); A/B test for conversion lift (aim 20%+)
- **Common Errors**: Wrong sizes lead to rejection; ensure no external links in screenshots
- **Broad Appeal**: Screenshots should convey "safer dating for everyone" through features, not visuals, to align with general positioning
