## **Summary**

Your Expo SDK 54 app is well-architected with successful React Native 0.81 and Reanimated v4 migrations. The main issues are:

**ðŸ”´ Critical (Must Fix):**
- Missing `verify-env.js` script (breaks build pipeline)  
- Security vulnerability: API keys exposed in client bundle
- App.json configuration cleanup

**ðŸŸ¡ Quality Issues:**
- 215 ESLint violations (mostly auto-fixable Prettier + unused vars)
- TypeScript `any` types reducing type safety  
- Missing web platform guards

**âœ… Already Working Well:**
- Expo SDK 54 + React Native 0.81 + React 19.1 compatibility
- Reanimated v4 migration complete
- Supabase integration solid
- New Architecture enabled correctly

The remediation plan provides concrete, actionable steps with specific file paths, commands, and code diffs. Start with Priority 1 items to ensure the app builds and runs securely, then proceed with quality improvements and comprehensive testing.
