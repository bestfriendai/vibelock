Context: Monorepo: No (single Expo app). Ensure best practices for Expo SDK 54, RN 0.81, React 19.
Primary success metric: a final, comprehensive, actionable plan to validate and stabilize the app on Expo 54, ready for EAS builds.
Note: Prefer Expo-compatible libraries. Flag any non-Expo-compatible native modules. Ensure mock paths exist for web and Expo Go.


Agent: Plan to understand the entire Expo app codebase and ensure everything is implemented correctly and fully functional on Expo SDK 54. Focus on research and validation derived from the declared dependencies/scripts in package.json, then map the repo and identify risk areas to test. Produce a step-by-step verification plan covering build, runtime, config, native integrations, and CI. Context below. 

Project summary:
- Platform: Expo SDK 54 (expo 54.0.2), React Native 0.81.4, React 19.1.0, React Native Web 0.21.0.
- Goal: Validate compatibility, peer-deps, configuration, and runtime readiness; propose fixes and a prioritized QA plan to reach a bug-free, production-ready state on SDK 54 for iOS/Android/Web.
- Key flows: Auth (Supabase), Chat (enhancedRealtimeChatService), Notifications (expo-notifications), Monetization (RevenueCat + AdMob), Reviews/Profiles, Deep Linking, Offline handling, Theming, Navigation (stack + tabs).
- Tooling: Jest + jest-expo 54, ESLint 9 + TS 5.9, Metro, Babel module resolver, patch-package, EAS config.

Repo layout (top-level):
- App.tsx (root app provider + NavigationContainer + init of services)
- index.ts, app.json, eas.json, metro.config.js, babel.config.js, tsconfig.json
- src/
  - api/
  - components/ (CustomTabBar, Error boundaries, OfflineBanner, AppOpenAdHandler, etc.)
  - config/
  - constants/
  - contexts/ (AdContext)
  - hooks/
  - navigation/ (AppNavigator.tsx defines stacks/tabs and auth gating)
  - providers/ (ThemeProvider)
  - screens/ (Browse, Search, CreateReview, Chatrooms, Profile, PersonProfile, ReviewDetail, SignIn, SignUp, Notifications, DeleteAccount, LocationSettings)
  - services/ (notificationService, realtimeChat, adMobService, etc.)
  - state/ (Zustand stores: authStore, chatStore, subscriptionStore)
  - types/, utils/
- android/, ios/ (native projects for run:android/run:ios with dev client)
- .expo/, assets/, patches/
- Firebase and Supabase config: firebase.json, firestore.rules, storage.rules, firestore.indexes.json, supabase/ + SQL scripts for storage buckets/policies.

package.json highlights:
- scripts: start, android, ios, web, check (typecheck + lint), verify:env, test (jest)
- dependencies: rich Expo module set (expo-notifications, camera, file-system, etc.), navigation v7, reanimated ^4.1.0, gesture-handler ~2.28.0, react-native-screens ~4.16.0, vector-icons 15, async-storage 2.2, shopify-skia 2.2.12, rn-mmkv 3.3.1, react-native-vision-camera ^4.7.2, expo-dev-client ~6.0.12, supabase-js ^2.57.4, firebase ^12.2.1, revenuecat (react-native-purchases ^9.4.0), admob (react-native-google-mobile-ads ^15.7.0), nativewind 4.1.23, tailwindcss 3.4.17, jest-expo ^54.0.10, ESLint 9, TS 5.9.

Key constraints and considerations:
- Ensure all versions are compatible with Expo SDK 54 (RN 0.81). Verify known constraints: reanimated v4 with RN 0.81; gesture-handler 2.28; screens 4.16; react-navigation v7; RN Skia 2.2.x; Vision Camera compatibility with Expo 54; RevenueCat SDK with RN 0.81; AdMob module linking with dev-client; iOS privacy strings & Android permissions; expo-notifications setup.
- Web support via react-native-web 0.21; confirm unsupported native modules are guarded behind buildEnv.hasNativeModules and fallbacks exist in Expo Go.
- Env strategy: process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_* keys only (per project notice). Verify scripts/verify-env.js and app usage.
- Deep linking: defined in App.tsx `linking` with prefixes and paths; ensure matching navigator route names.
- Jest setup with jest-expo 54 and React 19; RN 0.81 + RNTL 13.3; ensure proper test environment and setup files.
- EAS: eas.json present; metro + babel resolver configured; patch-package usage.

Deliverables expected from each agent:
1) A thorough, ordered verification plan (discovery → static checks → build-time checks → runtime checks → integration tests → release checks) with rationale.
2) A compatibility audit mapping each notable dependency to Expo 54/RN 0.81 support and any required version pins/patches.
3) A risk register highlighting likely failure points (navigation v7 with RN 0.81, Reanimated config & Babel plugin, Vision Camera permissions & dev-client requirements, RevenueCat/AdMob native integration on bare vs managed workflow, Expo Notifications setup, iOS/Android app.json/app.config extras).
4) A concrete test matrix (device OS versions, simulators/emulators, web browsers) with key smoke tests and E2E flows.
5) A prioritized fix plan and suggested `package.json` adjustments (version pins, scripts), and any native config changes to match Expo 54 guidelines.

Be concise but concrete; include quick checks (commands to run) and references to the canonical files to inspect. Assume read-only planning (no file writes).


Desired output: Finalize a comprehensive plan + risk register + compatibility audit + test matrix + recommended changes with justifications.

Files to consider: package.json, App.tsx

**Scanning configuration files**

I want to check permissions and privacy strings by scanning app.json and eas.json. It’s important to keep the introduction brief while still mentioning that I'm focusing on reading those key configuration files. Once I’ve done that, I should run the necessary commands to gather the information. Keeping the process straightforward will help ensure I extract the right details efficiently.
[2025-09-11T23:27:47] codex

I’ll quickly read package.json, App.tsx, and key config files (app.json, eas.json, babel/metro) to tailor the plan.

**Inspecting configuration files**

I'm thinking I should inspect several configuration files: babel.config.js, metro.config.js, jest.config.js, eas.json, app.json, tsconfig.json, and jest.setup.js. This will help me confirm if there are any compatibility pitfalls, like issues with the reanimated plugin, module-resolver aliases, or web mocks. Let's get started by reviewing these files one by one. That should give me a clearer picture of what might be going on!

**Evaluating React Native plugins**

I’m noticing that the required Babel plugin for react-native-reanimated seems to be absent. For RN 0.81 with Reanimated v4, I typically need it along with "react-native-worklets/plugin." Actually, for Reanimated 3+, I would be using "react-native-reanimated/plugin" instead. The current configuration places "react-native-worklets/plugin" last, which poses a risk since it’s missing "react-native-reanimated/plugin." Also, I'm considering that Expo 54 supports React Compiler, which is experimental for React 19, so I should check the metro.config.js for compatibility issues.

**Reviewing services and modules**

I need to review the `src/services` for the mentioned services and check `utils/buildEnvironment` to see how it detects native modules for web mocks. Also, I'm looking into `adMobService`, `notificationService`, and `realtimeChat` to confirm if they use expo-compatible libraries. It might be helpful to use a quick grep to search for specific modules across these files. I want to make sure everything is aligned correctly!

**Deciding on search tools**

It seems like rg isn't installed, so I’ll need to use an alternative for searching. I’m considering using grep -R instead. Of course, I should make sure that grep is suitable for the task at hand. I wonder if there are other options I should think about, but right now, grep -R looks like the best choice for searching through files, so that’s what I’ll go with!

**Reviewing expo-constants usage**

I’m noticing that they’re using expo-constants even though the app comment mentions it’s deprecated. But wait—it seems like it’s still present in Expo SDK 54, even if some usage might be discouraged. They’re advised against using expo-constants for the environment, opting for process.env instead. However, using it for appOwnership seems fine. Now, I should open adMobService, notificationService, and realtimeChat to check how they’re implemented.

**Evaluating Expo and plugin configurations**

I'm figuring out if Expo 54 supports MMKV with the "react-native-mmkv" config plugin. It usually goes in app.json, but expo's autolinking can work fine too. I need to check if the plugin for iOS App Groups is present since it's not strictly required. It’s important to verify compatibility with versions like react-native-screens 4.16.0 and gesture-handler 2.28.0, especially for RN 0.81, and ensure Babel is configured correctly for reanimated support.
**Checking dependencies and compatibility**

I'm looking into the jest setup that uses reanimated mock, which seems good! I want to check if lottie-react-native 7.3.1 is supported in Expo 54, as it uses Reanimated. It appears this version is compatible according to Expo SDK 54. However, using "expo-splash-screen" with Lottie should be fine. 

I need to confirm if "react-native-vision-camera ^4.7.2" works with Expo, but it has its own config plugin and permissions, which requires extra steps. I might consider removing it if not used, based on previous searches.
**Verifying map and plugin configurations**

I’m checking the "react-native-maps" config plugin for Expo. To use it, I'd incorporate "expo-build-properties" for maps, and this plugin is autolinked. On iOS, it requires the Google Maps SDK, but without extra configuration, it defaults to Apple Maps. For Android, the map SDK includes automatically, but I need to verify API keys for Google usage.

Next, I'll look into "react-native-worklets" version 0.5.1 to ensure compatibility with RN 0.81. There seems to be a configuration issue as both it and reanimated need to be the last plugins in Babel, which could be a failure point. Finally, I’ll check "nativewind" since its setup seems unusual, listed as a preset instead of a regular plugin.
**Reviewing NativeWind and Babel setup**

I’m looking into the setup for NativeWind version 4 because they suggest specifying `jsxImportSource` and adding the plugin. Expo docs advise putting the plugin under plugins, while NativeWind’s documentation presents "nativewind/babel" as an extra preset. This could be problematic since "nativewind/babel" is a plugin and should ideally be used in the plugins array rather than in presets. 

I should also check "react-dom 19.1.0" for compatibility with "react-native-web" version ^0.21.0, which seems okay. Additionally, I need to confirm jest's test environment setup. It specifies 'node' instead of 'jsdom', and I want to clarify which is appropriate for React Native tests.
**Assessing new Expo modules and compatibility**

I’m looking into RNTL with jest-expo, which defaults to a 'node' environment that seems alright for my needs. I need to check some new modules like "expo-insights" and "expo-audio"—the latter requiring microphone permission which is set in plugins and appears safe.

There's also "expo-network-addons," a potentially nonstandard third-party module that I'll need to ensure is compatible. Additionally, I’m evaluating "expo-live-photo" version 1.0.7, which is experimental, and checking "expo-video," which seems unified and okay. I’m also considering iOS-specific modules like "react-native-ios-context-menu" and "react-native-ios-utilities." Are they being used anywhere? I'll search for that.

**Identifying configuration mismatches**

I’m linking the config in App.tsx and noticing that route names like PersonProfile, ChatRoom, and others are present, but there’s no Onboarding route defined. That’s a risk. The MainTabs route matches up. For the PersonProfile path, it anticipates params like firstName, city, and state, but the stack expects a 'location' object, which creates a mismatch. This could cause issues for deep links. I'll have to include this in the plan and check providers/ThemeProvider for React Compiler compatibility.

**Identifying script issues**

Oh no, there's a broken script issue! The "verify:env" script is pointing to a node file, but I don't see a scripts folder. That's definitely a risk to address. Next, I need to check if any patch-package patches are needed by looking in the patches folder to see if it exists. I should list any patches as part of that check. Let’s get this sorted out!

**Evaluating custom patch risks**

There's a patch applied to expo-asset referencing a custom module called "VibecodeExpoModule," and I think that's quite risky and nonstandard. It could potentially disrupt assets in Expo Go and updates. I feel we really should flag this patch as nonstandard and possibly problematic, especially since no such module exists in the repo. I recommend either removing the patch or ensuring they provide the module. Now, I need to check the Supabase config.

**Examining Supabase and Expo Integration**

I noticed that if the Supabase configuration misses environment variables, it throws an error, breaking Expo Go at bundling time. They stress using environment keys like process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_*, which is fine since Expo handles injection. However, in Expo Go without the right EAS config, it's not fetched automatically, even though you could access it through app.json or dotenv in a dev environment. Expo CLI 48+ should automatically load `.env` for the EXPO_PUBLIC_ variables. It seems manageable!
**Identifying Risks in Configuration**

I’m noticing several potential risk items in the configuration. First, Babel is missing the reanimated plugin, and the order is wrong because "nativewind/babel" should be a plugin, not a preset. There are mismatched names for app deep linking. The "verify:env" script appears broken due to a missing file. Also, there are patches to expo-asset that reference a nonexistent module. Some native modules aren’t being used, causing potential EAS build bloat. For example, "react-native-vision-camera" needs further configuration but should be removed if unused. Lastly, for revenuecat, ensuring the "react-native-purchases" plugin is present is crucial, along with setting the "REVENUECAT_API_KEY." I need to look into where that’s referenced!

**Verifying environment keys and compatibility**

I’m looking at the environment keys needed: EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_IOS_API_KEY, EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_ANDROID_API_KEY, and EXPO_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID for Notifications. I noticed the verification script for the environment keys is missing, which should be flagged. It's also crucial to ensure compatibility of `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` version 2.2.0 with RN 0.81. Lastly, checking the usage of "react-native-skia," I found it’s not being utilized.
**Assessing dependencies and verification plan**

I can flag some components as unreferenced. For example, "lottie-react-native" version 7.3.1 might require `react-native-reanimated`, and it's compatible with RN 0.81. Then there's "react-native-vision-camera" that needs camera permissions but isn’t currently used, which poses a risk. 

Now, I’m checking various other dependencies, ensuring everything is compatible. I'll need to create a thorough verification plan that includes different checks, a compatibility audit for notable dependencies, a risk register, and a test matrix.
**Creating a prioritized fix plan**

I'm drafting a prioritized fix plan that suggests adjustments to the package.json and native configurations. I’ll present structured bullet points with section headers, keeping it concise yet concrete, and including necessary commands.

I also need to flag non-Expo-compatible modules like react-native-vision-camera and react-native-google-mobile-ads, which require a dev client. I'll categorize everything carefully. Additionally, I'll mention that web mocks appear to have gating via buildEnv.hasNativeModules, and we need to ensure proper gating for expo-notifications on the web. I'll also propose some test scripts and end-to-end flows using Expo's commands.
**Proposing configuration changes**

I’m suggesting changes to babel.config.js, especially to include the reanimated plugin last and ensure that the nativewind plugin is properly listed under plugins, not presets. Regarding the React Compiler, we need to be cautious because some libraries using className styles may break. 

Though Expo 54 recommends enabling the compiler, it doesn't do so by default, so we should plan to keep it disabled until we run tests. I also noticed a patch for 'expo-asset' that needs revisiting. Finally, we should align deep linking paths and propose adding permissions for both iOS and Android, especially for vision-camera.
**Preparing comprehensive documentation**

I need to finalize the output, which will consist of several key sections: Verification Plan, Compatibility Audit, Risk Register, Test Matrix, and Recommended Changes, all backed by commands and file references. I'll ensure a prioritized fix plan for package.json that includes necessary scripts, such as "verify:env" and possibly "prebuild." 

It’s crucial to clarify non-Expo-compatible modules and mention mocks being used. I'll include quick check commands like `npx expo doctor` and `npm run check`. Finally, I'll recommend changes regarding babel.config.js and metro.config.js, ensuring it remains concise yet comprehensive without losing essential details.

Here’s a concise, end-to-end plan to validate, stabilize, and ship this Expo SDK 54 app. It’s tailored to your repo and flags concrete risks I found in code and config.

**Verification Plan**

- Discovery: confirm SDK 54 shape
  - Commands: `npx expo-doctor`, `npx expo config --type public`, `node -v && npm -v`
  - Files: `package.json`, `app.json`, `babel.config.js`, `metro.config.js`, `eas.json`, `jest.config.js`, `jest.setup.js`
- Static checks: types/lint/peers
  - Commands: `npm run check`, `npx expo install --check`, `npx expo-doctor --fix`
  - Inspect: missing `scripts/verify-env.js` (script exists but file missing); remove or add it
- Build-time checks: ensure native plugins + Babel
  - iOS/Android dev client: `npx expo prebuild` (dry-run first), then `expo run:ios`, `expo run:android`
  - EAS preflight: `eas build:configure`, `eas build --profile development --platform ios|android`
  - Validate Babel: add `react-native-reanimated/plugin` last; move `nativewind/babel` to plugins
- Runtime checks: Go/dev-client/web
  - Expo Go (web/native-mocks): `npm start`, web: `npm run web`
  - Dev clients (native modules): `expo run:ios`, `expo run:android`
  - Validate deep linking paths, navigation route names, push token retrieval, env presence
- Integration checks: services and flows
  - Supabase auth + realtime chat, notifications channels/tokens, AdMob mock/native, RevenueCat mock/native
  - Media permissions (camera/microphone), file-system, image/video modules
- Release checks: store readiness
  - iOS privacy strings/manifests, SKAdNetwork, ATT prompt timing
  - Android permissions, google-services.json, app IDs, versioning
  - EAS prod build: `eas build --profile production --platform ios|android`

**Compatibility Audit (Expo SDK 54 / RN 0.81 / React 19)**

- Core
  - expo 54.0.2: OK
  - react-native 0.81.4: OK
  - react 19.1.0 + react-dom 19.1.0: OK (be wary with React Compiler)
  - react-native-web ^0.21.0: OK
- Navigation
  - @react-navigation v7 (native/stack/bottom-tabs/material-top-tabs): OK with RN 0.81
  - react-native-screens ~4.16.0, gesture-handler ~2.28.0: OK
- Animations
  - react-native-reanimated ^4.1.0: Supported on RN 0.81 but requires Babel plugin. Missing in `babel.config.js` currently. Must add `"react-native-reanimated/plugin"` last.
  - react-native-worklets 0.5.1: Compatible; ensure plugin ordering does not conflict with Reanimated’s “last” rule.
- Styling
  - nativewind ^4.1.23: Supported; use `"plugins": ["nativewind/babel"]` (not a preset). `jsxImportSource: "nativewind"` OK.
- Storage
  - @react-native-async-storage/async-storage 2.2.0: OK; app uses this (MMKV not used)
  - react-native-mmkv ^3.3.1: Requires dev client; not referenced in code. Optional/remove if unused.
- Media/Graphics
  - @shopify/react-native-skia 2.2.12: Requires dev client; not referenced. Optional/remove if unused.
  - react-native-vision-camera ^4.7.2: Requires dev client + additional native config; not referenced. High risk if kept; remove or gate.
  - expo-camera ~17.0.7, expo-image, expo-video: SDK 54 modules OK.
- Monetization/Ads
  - react-native-purchases ^9.4.0: Compatible via EAS/Dev Client (not in Expo Go). Code gates via buildEnv; OK.
  - react-native-google-mobile-ads ^15.7.0: Works with EAS/Dev Client via config plugin present in `app.json`. Not in Expo Go; code gates; OK.
- Notifications
  - expo-notifications ~0.32.11: OK. iOS strings present; Android channel setup in service; ensure EXPO_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID set for token retrieval.
- Other natives
  - react-native-maps 1.20.1: Works in dev client; not referenced. Safe but remove if unused.
  - react-native-webview 13.15.0: OK
  - lottie-react-native ~7.3.1: OK on RN 0.81
  - react-native-ios-context-menu 3.1.3, react-native-ios-utilities 5.1.8: Native-only; not referenced. Remove if unused.
- Tooling/Tests
  - jest-expo ^54.0.10 + jest ~29.7.0: OK with RN 0.81
  - @testing-library/react-native ^13.3.3: OK
  - ESLint 9 + TS 5.9: OK
- Patches
  - patches/expo-asset@12.0.8.patch: Nonstandard; references nonexistent `VibecodeExpoModule`. High risk for assets/resolution. Either remove patch or implement that module.

**Risk Register**

- Babel config (High): Missing `react-native-reanimated/plugin` and wrong placement of `nativewind/babel` as a preset. Reanimated may crash or worklets not compile; subtle runtime errors possible.
- Deep linking mismatches (High): App.tsx `linking.config.screens` includes `Onboarding` (no route defined) and `PersonProfile` path params (`firstName/:city/:state`) don’t match navigator’s `PersonProfile` params (expects location object). Broken links.
- Patch-package on expo-asset (High): Patch depends on `VibecodeExpoModule` which is not in the repo. Can break asset loading, Expo Go behavior, updates.
- Missing env verifier script (Medium): `verify:env` points to `scripts/verify-env.js` which doesn’t exist. CI/Dev checks won’t run; env drift risks (Supabase/Notifications/RevenueCat).
- React Compiler enabled (Medium): `"reactCompiler": true` may surface incompatibilities with some libs (especially heavy worklets/animated usage). Keep toggleable; validate incrementally.
- Non-Expo-Go modules (Medium): Vision Camera, MMKV, Skia, Maps, iOS-only libs are unused but present; increases build surface and potential plugin conflicts. Remove or guard usage.
- AdMob/ATT timing (Medium): ATT string present, but ensure you gate ad initialization until after ATT consent (iOS review guidelines).
- Notifications token fetch (Medium): Requires `EXPO_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID`. Ensure set in all envs (dev, EAS, prod). Token acquisition fails otherwise.
- Metro customizations (Low/Medium): Custom `asyncRequireModulePath`, parser flags and resolver tweaks may be unnecessary on SDK 54 and could introduce edge issues; prefer defaults unless specifically required.
- Web mocks (Low): Most native modules guarded via `buildEnv.hasNativeModules` and mocks exist. Verify all native entry-points are lazy imported/gated to prevent bundling crashes on web.

**Test Matrix**

- iOS
  - Devices: iPhone 15 Pro (iOS 18), iPhone 12 (iOS 17.4)
  - Builds: Expo Go smoke, Dev Client (run:ios), EAS production
- Android
  - Devices: Pixel 8 (Android 14), Pixel 6 (Android 13)
  - Builds: Expo Go smoke, Dev Client (run:android), EAS production
- Web
  - Browsers: Chrome (latest), Safari 17+, Firefox (latest)
- Quick smoke scenarios
  - Auth: Sign In/Up, session persistence, logout
  - Chat: Join room, send message, receive realtime updates
  - Notifications: Foreground receipt, tap handling, Android channels
  - Deep links: Open `locker-room-talk://chat/<id>`, `https://lockerroom.app/review/<id>`
  - Monetization: Paywall display, mock purchase in Expo Go, RevenueCat initialization in dev client
  - Ads: AppOpen + interstitial gating; mock path in Expo Go
  - Media: Image picker, camera permission request (in dev client), upload flow
  - Offline: Banner visibility, retry flows
  - Theming: Toggle dark/high-contrast; status bar and colors stable
  - Navigation: Tab switching, stack modals, back behavior
  - Web-only: Feature fallbacks for native modules; ensure no crashes on initial load

**Prioritized Fix Plan**

- P0: Babel and deep linking
  - Add `"react-native-reanimated/plugin"` last in `plugins`.
  - Move `"nativewind/babel"` from `presets` to `plugins`.
  - Consider disabling `reactCompiler` temporarily to stabilize; re-enable after passes.
  - Align deep links with navigator:
    - Remove `Onboarding` from `linking`.
    - Update `PersonProfile` path to match params (e.g., `profile/:firstName/:city/:state`) AND navigator type to match route params, or simplify to route IDs.
- P0: Remove/resolve risky patch
  - Delete `patches/expo-asset@12.0.8.patch` or provide the matching `VibecodeExpoModule`. Without it, asset resolution is undefined in Go/updates.
- P0: Env readiness
  - Add missing `scripts/verify-env.js` or remove script. Verify required keys exist:
    - `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
    - `EXPO_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID` (expo-notifications)
    - `EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_IOS_API_KEY`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_ANDROID_API_KEY`
  - Quick command: `npm run verify:env` (once script exists)
- P1: Native module scope cleanup
  - Remove or defer unused: `react-native-vision-camera`, `react-native-mmkv`, `@shopify/react-native-skia`, `react-native-maps`, `react-native-ios-context-menu`, `react-native-ios-utilities` unless you will use them in v1. This reduces build footprint and plugin complexity.
- P1: Metro defaults
  - Revert non-essential customizations unless proven needed on RN 0.81:
    - `transformer.asyncRequireModulePath`, hermesParser toggles, custom main fields and `sourceExts.push("cjs")`. SDK 54 defaults are solid; keep config minimal.
- P1: ATT/Consent
  - Ensure ad initialization waits for ATT consent on iOS (before first ad request). Add prompt flow if needed, or document that ads run non-personalized until consent.
- P2: Web mocks completeness
  - Review all native entry points for lazy/dynamic import and `buildEnv.hasNativeModules` gating (AdMob, RevenueCat are good; Vision Camera not referenced). Ensure notifications do not crash web (current code guards non-device).
- P2: CI and scripts
  - Add convenience scripts:
    - `"doctor": "expo-doctor"`, `"prebuild:clean": "expo prebuild --clean"`, `"dev:ios": "expo run:ios"`, `"dev:android": "expo run:android"`
  - Wire EAS build workflows for preview/production; ensure `eas.json` consistent with app IDs and bundle identifiers.

**Recommended `package.json` Adjustments**

- Scripts
  - Add: `"doctor": "expo-doctor"`, `"prebuild": "expo prebuild"`, `"dev:ios": "expo run:ios"`, `"dev:android": "expo run:android"`, `"postinstall": "patch-package || true"` (if keeping patches)
  - Fix/remove: `"verify:env"` until `scripts/verify-env.js` is added
- Dev deps
  - Keep: `jest-expo@^54`, `@testing-library/react-native@^13.3.3`
- Deps (cleanup optional)
  - Remove unused: `react-native-vision-camera`, `react-native-mmkv`, `@shopify/react-native-skia`, `react-native-maps`, `react-native-ios-context-menu`, `react-native-ios-utilities` unless they’re planned imminently
- Babel
  - babel.config.js should look like:
    - presets: `[["babel-preset-expo", { jsxImportSource: "nativewind", reactCompiler: false }]]`
    - plugins: `["nativewind/babel", "react-native-reanimated/plugin", "react-native-worklets/plugin"]` with “react-native-reanimated/plugin” last; if you must keep worklets, ensure RNRA plugin remains last
- Metro
  - Prefer default from `expo/metro-config`. Only add custom options proven necessary.

**Build/Runtime Validation Steps (Quick Checklist)**

- Doctor and install
  - Run `npx expo-doctor` → fix any mismatches
  - Run `npx expo install --check` → align versions if needed
- Local tests
  - `npm run check`, `npm test`
- Expo Go smoke
  - `npm start` then iOS/Android clients: validate navigation, auth UI, chat list, mock ads, mock purchases, offline banner, theming, web at `npm run web`
- Dev client native
  - `expo run:ios`, `expo run:android` then validate:
    - RevenueCat initializes, offerings load, purchase flow (sandbox)
    - AdMob AppOpen/Interstitials honor gating
    - Notifications: permission prompt, token retrieved (logs); Android channels created
    - Deep links: device links route correctly
- EAS
  - `eas build --profile preview --platform ios|android` to validate CI config
  - `eas build --profile production --platform ios|android` once green

**Notable File Callouts**

- App.tsx: Deep linking config mismatches with routes. Fix `PersonProfile` param model and remove `Onboarding`.
- babel.config.js: Add `react-native-reanimated/plugin` last; move `nativewind/babel` to plugins.
- patches/: Nonstandard expo-asset patch relies on missing module. Remove/replace.
- app.json: Permissions and AdMob plugin look correct; SKAdNetwork IDs are duplicated in places—trim duplicates.
- metro.config.js: Prefer minimal config; SDK 54 defaults are good.
- jest.setup.js: Reanimated v4 mock present; good.
